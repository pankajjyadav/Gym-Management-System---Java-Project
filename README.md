A modest Java project, the Gym Management System, has been developed to assist gym managers in efficiently managing their trainers, members, and inventory of equipment. The project features a Command Line Interface (CLI) that provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for performing various activities related to gym management.

Features:

Trainer Management: Add, update, and remove trainers from the system.

Member Management: Keep track of gym members, their details, and membership status.

Equipment Inventory: Manage the inventory of gym equipment, including additions and removals.

User-Friendly CLI: The Command Line Interface ensures easy navigation and interaction with the system.

Data Persistence: The system supports data persistence to store information between sessions.
